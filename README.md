UPDATE: I've largely abandoned this. GoToSocial meets my needs for now.

I'm experimenting with some ActivityPub implementations in Golang.

This is intended to be a very small or personal ActivityPub server that extends an existing blog. It's not intended to support a large community of users on a single server. The goal is to create something extremely lightweight which consumes very few resources; something that facilitates communication of ActivityPub objects, but isn't necessarily intended to store those objects forever.

See docs/README.md for a loose project plan.
